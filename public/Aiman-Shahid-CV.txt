I am a Computer Science undergraduate at LCWU, developing a
strong foundation in Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering,
Database Systems, and Data Structures. Alongside my degree, I’m
pursuing an AI diploma from PIAIC, where I’ve gained hands-on
experience with OpenAI SDK, Python, n8n workflows, and agentic AI
systems. I actively enhance my coding skills through Vibe Coding and
enjoy building real-world projects that combine logic, creativity, and
intelligent automation.
